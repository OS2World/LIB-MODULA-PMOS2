STATUS OF THE PROJECTS IN THE "PMOS/2 tests" workplace
======================================================

NOTE: ALL of the graphics programs fail since XDS 2.30 was installed.
Cause not yet known, but the failure is occurring in module "Graph".

------------------------------------------------------------

EditTest:  Working.

GrafTst1:  Working, except that I haven't yet figured out how to change the
           size of the display area on a "mode change".

STATUS OF THE PROJECTS IN THE "PMOS/2 Demo" workplace
======================================================

BarDemo:   Working except for the sideways text.

BeeSwarm:  Working, but so slow that it loses its point.  The speed difference
           between this and the DOS version is enormous.

GrafDemo:  Working (I think - haven't checked in great detail)

GrafTest:  Working except for an error beep on every call to SetMode.

LineDemo:  Closing a window is terribly slow, and there's a minor screen
           corruption that looks as if the clip area is out by one pixel.
           Otherwise working.

Menutest:  Working.

MPtest:    Working.

SpeakerT:  Working.

Testcalc:  Working.
