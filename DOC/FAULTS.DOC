FAULTS IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF PMOS/2
=======================================

Keyboard module: cannot handle ^C, ^P, or ^S - system seems to intercept these
   before we can read them.

Mouse: I haven't yet figured out how to stop the system from intercepting
   mouse clicks.

Graphics support: now exists, but still at a crude level.
