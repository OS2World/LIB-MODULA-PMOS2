FAULTS IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF PMOS/2
=======================================

Kernel: present version is full of testing code, needs tidying up.

Keyboard module: cannot handle ^C, ^P, or ^S - system seems to intercept these
   before we can read them.

Mouse: I haven't yet figured out how to stop the system from intercepting
   mouse clicks.

Graphics support: now exists, but still at a crude level.

PM sessions: not yet supported, this is on my "to do" list for the future, but
   it will be some time before this is working properly.  (I have some test
   software for the PM case, but it's nowhere near being ready for release.
   I want to get the VIO version cleaned up first.)
